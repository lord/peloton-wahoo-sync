this chrome extension syncs peloton classes with a wahoo bike trainer (or possibly another trainer that uses the same bluetooth protocols). the resistance data from the peloton class you are watching is automatically sent to the trainer as you progress through the video. the 'scale' option allows you to multiply the peloton by a custom percentage before it gets sent to the trainer; this is useful both because wahoo percentages are way more difficult than peloton percentages, and also so that you can dynamically make this easier or harder during your ride as you'd like. i've calibrated rpm for my particular bike setup (the zwift standing bike thing); you may need to fiddle with it to get the number to display correctly.

to install, just clone this repo and then load it as an unpacked extension in chrome
